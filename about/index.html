<p>Hello, I am <a href="http://www.vaishaksuresh.com">Vaishak</a>. This is site is an effort towards honing my photography and web developments skills. </p>
<h3>What is Project 52?</h3>
<p>With Project 52, I hope to <strike>click</strike> post one picture every week, for the next 52 weeks. Each photograph will be based on a particular theme. </p>
<h3>Why not Project 365?</h3>
<p>I am sure clicking and posting one picture everyday for a years is a learning and rewarding experience, but it also requires some serious commitment. considering the time I have available for photography right now, I don't think I am ready for that kind of commitment.</p>
